### Document Flow

If you have any document flow whatsoever on your page, it certainly won't do if you can only zoom with the mouse wheel. Because that would scroll the document at the same time. Thanks to [Hellow2](https://github.com/HeIIow2) for document flow and control buttons features.

My sollution was inspired by [Google-Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/control-default). You can set the prop `enableWheelOnKey` to whatever key button you like. _(Every value that can be found in KeyEvents `event.key` are valid and should work)_. If `enableWheelOnKey` is set, the zoom on Wheel will only work, if simmultaniously the corresponding Button is pressed.

If you have a document flow, it is reccomended, to set `enableWheelOnKey` to the value `Control`.

```vue
<VueZoomable :enableWheelOnKey="'Control'">
</VueZoomable>
```

Now usually `Control` + `wheel` zooms in and out of the viewport. This... isn't good. Arguably this is a worse ux as scrolling while zooming. That's why I prevent it when following cases are all met:

- `enableWheelOnKey` is set to `"Control"`
- the mouse is within the bounds of the container element
- you... well would zoom the viewport

Because this could be unintuitive, I implemented a message that tells you what you need to do to actually zoom, that appears after you would have zoomed without this. Just like [Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/control-default) did.

### Events

- panned
- zoom

All events have argument of type `ZoomableEvent`.

### ZoomableEvent

| Field | Type   | Description                                                                     |
| ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| zoom  | number | Current zoom value                                                              |
| pan   | object | Current pan value and delta change in case of `panned` event.                   |
| type  | string | Source type which triggered the event. `dblClick`, `mouse`, `touch` or `wheel`. |

_Sample event data:_

```json
{
  "zoom": 0.3,
  "pan": {
    "x": 100,
    "y": 2,
    "deltaX": 0,
    "deltaY": 2
  },
  "type": "mouse"
}
```
